# Text Categorization with Naive Bayes
- Two variants of Naive Bayes Algorithm
- Smoothing

In this project, I have implemented two variants of the Naive Bayes algorithm with smoothing and applied it to classify text into two different categories.

Type 1 variant performs better and computes accuracy faster than Type 2 variant. In any case, performance is better with smoothing than without smoothing.
